        "description": "Together with a team of four second year Mechanical Engineering students, I researched and designed a DIY hobbyist CNC Router setup for my MIE243 Mechanical Engineering Design course. This involved developping the engineering specifications, budgeting, researching components, and creating CAD parts and assemblies in SolidWorks. The final conceptual design included a 2ft by 3ft bed with a belt drive system in the x and y axis as well as a lead screw setup in the z axis all ran by encoded stepper motors. The design can hold a 2.2kW spindle motor capable of cutting various materials including soft metals and aluminum. The total material cost is under $2300 CAD.",

In this course, I learned how to operate a mill, drill press and lathe and used my knowledge to machine a miniature piston with a functional crank slider. The piston is also capable of spinning by feeding pressurized air into the block.  ",

The design was built using SolidWorks and later 3D printed at the Myhal DigiFab Lab. The gear box was then tested in class to ensure it's structural integrity, functionality and ease of assembly. ",

        "description": "In an attempt to create a more fun and engaging way to improve resume writing, I along with two of my friends created the Resume Roast Webpage for our Ignition Hacks Hackathon submission. Resume Roast takes the user's resume, and uses AI to generate a track by Drake, which disses their resume in a personalized and playful manner to highlight its weaknesses. The user is then prompted by an AI Kendrick Lamar who will delivers constructive criticisms and offering actionable advice for improving your resume in the form a rap song set to an iconic beat. The frontend for the webpage was built with React, Tailwind, and JavaScript. The backend used Node.js, Google AI Studio to generate lyrics, and Elevenlabs API to generate the Drake and Kendrick vocals.",
